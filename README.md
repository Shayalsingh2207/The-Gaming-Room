Overview

This repository contains my completed software design document for Draw It or Lose It, developed for The Gaming Room as part of the CS 230 course. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze software requirements, evaluate system architectures, and communicate technical design decisions clearly to both clients and development teams.

Client and Software Requirements

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand its existing game, Draw It or Lose It, into a distributed, multi-platform application. The software needed to support multiple teams and players, ensure unique game and team names, and scale efficiently across different operating systems. The goal was to design a reliable client-server solution that could support performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Strengths in the Design Document

One area I performed particularly well was analyzing and explaining system architecture options, including operating platforms, memory management, storage considerations, and distributed system concepts. I focused on clearly communicating technical decisions in a way that aligned with the client’s goals and could be easily understood by development team members.

Value of the Design Process

Creating the design document before writing code was extremely helpful. It allowed me to think through requirements, constraints, and system structure early in the process. This planning reduced potential implementation issues and made the development process more organized and efficient.

Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one part of this work, I would expand the security and deployment sections. Adding more real-world examples, such as authentication methods, cloud security practices, and deployment workflows, would improve the overall depth and practicality of the document.

Interpreting User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on usability, reliability, and scalability. Designing with the user in mind is critical because software success depends on how well it meets user expectations. Considering user needs helps ensure a positive user experience and long-term success of the application.

Software Design Approach

My approach to software design involved breaking down requirements, evaluating architectural alternatives, and documenting decisions clearly before implementation. In future projects, I plan to continue using techniques such as UML diagrams, modular design, and iterative planning to analyze and design similar software applications.
